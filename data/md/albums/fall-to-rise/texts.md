## Then We Were Flying

Then we were flying  
Over the lights of that sleepless town  
Oh and we weren't looking down

From an old wooded dancehall  
Into the streets and out in the dark  
What was to come and all that's come to pass

Then we were flying  
Over the lights of that restless town  
Oh and we weren't looking down

Up in a stairwell  
Moon streaming full through a balcony door  
Oh for the court and spark that starts the fall

When we were flying  
Over the lights of that reckless town  
Oh and we weren't looking down

## In Between The Lines

Circling the ground, it's such a long ways back  
Out among the hills there's a little shack  
Down in the valley, the wind in the pines  
There's no way of staying in between the lines  

Walking in the dark, I notice all the lights  
Guess I had to do things wrong to get a few things right  
Down in the valley, the wind in the pines  
There's no way of staying in between the lines  

Hear the wind blowing, see the eagle fly  
There's no way of knowing how or when or why  
Down in the valley, the wind in the pines  
There's no way of staying in between the lines  

I lost track of all the hours, I can't name this day  
Still I keep on hoping I will find my way  
Down in the valley, the wind in the pines  
There's no way of staying in between the lines

## Coming Up Crimson

It's coming up crimson, coming up gold  
Coming up bright, coming on cold  
And the smoke is rising in drifts of white  
From factory stacks at the edge of town in the shifting light

Riding out past these steep-pitched roofs  
With my very blood pinging and brimming and swimming with the thought of  
you  
And of us driving between cities last night  
Your pretty hands at the wheel, me curled up on the passenger side

It's coming up crimson, coming up gold  
Rushing up so wild and taking a hold  
And it's a blushing smile that I can't hide  
How'd you do that thing and light up all these lights

Past the window boxes, past the flowering vines  
Out past the old red forest, out past the wind turbines  
I can't keep still when I'm feeling this way  
I'm heading down to the Escobar Fjord at the break of the day

## 350 Parts Per Million  

Listening not to know  
Just to try to understand  
Just to try  

Felt just like a vision quest  
Maybe it was just a test  
Just a test  

10, 000 years of Holocene   
Disappearing just like snow  
And every spring you still grow  
On the earth among the butterflies  
Up from the ground, the colors of the crow   

Just outside of old Eau Claire  
Through the tunnel, are you there?  
Are you there?  

Dreaming up tattoos in your head  
While I slept deeply in your bed  
In your bed  

Towing 350 parts   
Per million of carbon love   
Can we safely hold?  

10, 000 years of Holocene   
Disappearing just like snow  
And every spring you still grow  
On the earth among the butterflies  
Up from the ground, the colors of the crow   
Sing the dirt, sing the fields,   
Sing the forest while it's here    

Don't stop dancing, take the time  
To find the land and carry it  
Carry it  

Bow and arrow, water and stone  
Carving through the velvet bone  
In harmony  

Here or there or everywhere   
We fall to rise, this is in your eyes  
And it comforts me   

10, 000 years of Holocene   
Disappearing just like snow  
And every spring you still grow  
On the earth among the butterflies  
Up from the ground, the colors of the crow

## Little Bird, Gentle Bear

Up from the gate   
Take the track all the way   
To the clearing on the hill   
Up where it's quiet still   

In the summer's heat   
With silks that you'd weave   
Work the loom with its steady clack   
Our love's woven like that   

Where we let the world slide   
From this sweet mountain side   
In this life that we share   
Little bird, gentle bear   

In the winter you'd forge   
Hammered steel to a sword   
The sweat and carbon black   
Our love is strong like that   

Drinking blackberry 'shine   
Under cascading skies   
Your hand at my back   
Our love is sweet like that   

Where we let the world fall   
Here away from it all   
I've been right here by your side   
And darlin you're still here by mine   

Where we let the world slide   
From this sweet mountain side   
In this life that we share   
Little bird, gentle bear

## Causeway

I know it's early,   
But I've been awake, I'm gonna walk  
Over that cresting hill past the house  
Down where the road   
Swings to the left  
The light is changing up on the ridge  
I'm gonna stand on that causeway  
River in flood, song in my head  

I'm not going back  

Nothing to chase now  
No-one to answer, no-one to tell  
It's only a question  
That I've always had, I know it so well  
The hours can hide me  
Here with the shadows just coming around  
I'm gonna stand on that causeway  
River in flood, lost in the sound  

I'm not going back  

There are still stars out  
Oh how the future burns with the past  
I'm gonna stand on that causeway  
Heart running wild as the river runs fast  

I'm not going back

## Driftless Now

Starlings out on a burning wind  
Sweeping high above the Midewin  
Little Bluestem under the weeds  
What you find, what you need  

Broken bike and an old truck tire  
Rusted wheels, rusted wire  
Mama's picture hanging from a chain  
What you lost, what remains  

Sending messages straight down the line  
Driftless now, will you ever be mine?  

Once was tall grass down a dark hall  
Water falls down a crying wall  
Dust clustered in the corners like drifts of snow  
What you had, what you know  

Sending messages straight down the line  
Driftless now, will you ever be mine?  

Looking straight ahead, aiming high  
Through the open air of a prairie sky  
Memories swimming in the morning light  
What you got wrong, what you got right  

Sending messages straight down the line  
Driftless now, will you ever be mine?

## Seaside Blues

I've got you on my mind  
I've got you on my mind  
Been trying to fight it but you're  
Not the forgetting kind  

Can't make heads or tails  
I can't make heads or tails  
Been trying to fight it but you're  
Caught up in my sails  

Down to the river, out to the sea  
That's where you've been taking me  

Nobody's fault but mine  
Nobody's fault but mine  
Been trying to fight it but I'm  
Tangled in your line  

Down to the river, out to the sea  
That's where you've been taking me

## Holding No One

Royal blue hat from the five and dime  
Spilling gut whiskey into fancy wine  
Branded by demons and a jagged line  
Asking for favors and water and sun  
Belonging nowhere, holding no one  
Holding no one  

Arms of forgiveness forgiven by way  
Of giving up hope with nothing to say  
Stumbling through streets, searching faces and rest  
Dreaming in shadows, knees to the vest  
Dancing in quiet and stillness, and blessed  
Holding no one  

One for the money, two for a show  
Three for tomorrow lost in snow  
Tracks telling stories, night's almost blind  
Another in another dark left behind  
Taking chances of any kind  
Holding no one

## To The Sun

Came in on a spring wind like the oldest spell  
Drawn like a flower to the sun   
When you're here with me  
Oh babe I never felt so sweet  
I'm gonna stay right here  
You can show me how that spell got spun  

We won't need to go out, we don't need no phone  
There's no one else I'd wanna tell  
When you watch me coming down those stairs  
Round brown shoulders and tangled hair  
I'm gonna stay right here  
You can show me all around the world
