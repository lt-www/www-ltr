## Golden Plains

They’re coming in by foot and wagon\
coming in from every place\
you can catch the scent of the fever\
no wild rain can wash away

We’ve never seen nothing like it\
things are changing every day\
it’s turning up in the dirt and gravel\
flashes in the riverbeds and the clay

They say\
it’s wild\
the veins keep stretching\
out, over and down, it’s rife\
with fortune shifters

One for frost, two for fire\
fine bright golden flooding plains\
I climb up through the granite boulders\
and watch ‘em come in droves now everyday

They say\
it’s wild\
there’s more I know it\
more, it’s turning me bold and wild\
the plains are golden

I was born down at Merriganowry\
I’ve been along the Lachlan all my life\
and just like my sisters before me\
I’ve been made somebody’s wife

I’m still\
a child\
though I’ve seen plenty\
Oh but this heart is wild\
and future heavy

There’s more I know it\
more, it’s turning me bold and wild\
the plains are golden

## Thief

I keep real quiet\
bringing fuel in for the stove\
I’m gonna feed this fire\
so that you can see the smoke

I reckon mama’s known it\
right there from the moment you walked in

That moment when your eyes held mine\
I’ve never known something make me shine so bright\
I can’t think straight, I’m in whirl\
this thief of horses gonna steal my world

I can’t think straight, I can’t eat\
my heart is charging and I sure can’t sleep\ 
I’ve never known nothing like this charge and spark\ 
this thief of horses gonna steal my heart

And while they’re sleeping\
I listen for that sound\
I wanna hear that rumble\
I wanna know just what we’ve found

I know mama’s seen it\
and I’m sure not what I used to be

I can’t concentrate on nothing else\
I can’t think straight and I can’t help myself\
that voice those hands, I’m in a whirl\
this thief of horses gonna steal my world

A fire is burning and it’s in my blood\
caught red-handed in a flashing flood\
I’ve never known nothing like this charge and spark\
this thief of horses gonna steal my heart
