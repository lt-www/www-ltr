## Golden Plains

They’re coming in by foot and wagon\
coming in from every place\
you can catch the scent of the fever\
no wild rain can wash away\ 

We’ve never seen nothing like it\
things are changing every day\
it’s turning up in the dirt and gravel\
flashes in the riverbeds and the clay\

They say\
it’s wild\
the veins keep stretching\
out, over and down, it’s rife\
with fortune shifters\

One for frost, two for fire\
fine bright golden flooding plains\
I climb up through the granite boulders\ 
and watch ‘em come in droves now everyday\

They say\
it’s wild\
there’s more I know it\
more, it’s turning me bold and wild\
the plains are golden\

I was born down at Merriganowry\
I’ve been along the Lachlan all my life\
and just like my sisters before me\
I’ve been made somebody’s wife\

I’m still\
a child\
though I’ve seen plenty\
Oh but this heart is wild\
and future heavy\

There’s more I know it\
more, it’s turning me bold and wild\
the plains are golden\
