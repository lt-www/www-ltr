## Golden Plains

They’re coming in by foot and wagon\
coming in from every place\
you can catch the scent of the fever\
no wild rain can wash away

We’ve never seen nothing like it\
things are changing every day\
it’s turning up in the dirt and gravel\
flashes in the riverbeds and the clay

They say\
it’s wild\
the veins keep stretching\
out, over and down, it’s rife\
with fortune shifters

One for frost, two for fire\
fine bright golden flooding plains\
I climb up through the granite boulders\
and watch ‘em come in droves now everyday

They say\
it’s wild\
there’s more I know it\
more, it’s turning me bold and wild\
the plains are golden

I was born down at Merriganowry\
I’ve been along the Lachlan all my life\
and just like my sisters before me\
I’ve been made somebody’s wife

I’m still\
a child\
though I’ve seen plenty\
Oh but this heart is wild\
and future heavy

There’s more I know it\
more, it’s turning me bold and wild\
the plains are golden

## Thief

I keep real quiet\
bringing fuel in for the stove\
I’m gonna feed this fire\
so that you can see the smoke

I reckon mama’s known it\
right there from the moment you walked in

That moment when your eyes held mine\
I’ve never known something make me shine so bright\
I can’t think straight, I’m in whirl\
this thief of horses gonna steal my world

I can’t think straight, I can’t eat\
my heart is charging and I sure can’t sleep\
I’ve never known nothing like this charge and spark\
this thief of horses gonna steal my heart

And while they’re sleeping\
I listen for that sound\
I wanna hear that rumble\
I wanna know just what we’ve found

I know mama’s seen it\
and I’m sure not what I used to be

I can’t concentrate on nothing else\
I can’t think straight and I can’t help myself\
that voice those hands, I’m in a whirl\
this thief of horses gonna steal my world

A fire is burning and it’s in my blood\
caught red-handed in a flashing flood\
I’ve never known nothing like this charge and spark\
this thief of horses gonna steal my heart

## Wheogo Hill

Blankets drawn against the sun\
but still there’s sun on skin\
shadows dance in the light\
let it in, let it in

Been watching the hens scratching\
over frozen ground\
oh how I’ve been dreaming\
since you’ve been coming round

One wild-wind night\
you chanced to call\
and if you call this thunder\
then let it roll, let it roll

## Nothing Comes Close

My sister Biddy came by today\
talking what she's talking lately\
wondering if she'll go or if she'll stay\
and so much crying about the babies

Oh my little sister I'm troubled too\
you know I've been down with sorrow\
but it feels like things with Frank are true\
it's got me thinking about tomorrows

You know they'll keep being on out there mustering\
and we'll keep toiling under\
I look out across the rise for him\
and my ears strain for hooves like thunder, like they’re straining now

The way I've sailed me out to sea\
gone n swept myself right off my feet\
everything else you can have it back\
Oh nothing comes close to me and my Frank

Of course I know he's a wild one\
course I know the troubles he's under\
but in his arms a light lets in\
a flood of hope and wonder

They're flashing eyes, it's a wicked grin\
and the way he says so sweetly\
the things I love to hear him say\
you know I think i'm gone completely, yeah I’m a goner now 

The way I've sailed me out to sea\
gone n swept myself right off my feet\
everything else you can take it back\
Oh nothing comes close to me and my Frank

I wonder how long it could stay this way\
and what of you and Jim and Henry\
Biddy, Frank's been talking about far away\
talking just me and my Frankie

It's a rough scrub it's a rocky soil\
that we keep toiling daily\
one of these days we might get away\
one of these days just maybe

## All The Love

Mares stirring out across the yard\
heart churning as the night grows dark\
me and Frankie got the stars to guide\
pretty soon we're gonna run not hide

We'll have all we gotta have\
running rivers, got the heavens above\
we have all we wanna have\
me and Frankie we got all the love

We'll be careful, we'll time it right\
next dark moon in the dead of night\
me and my baby and the guiding stars\
it's now or never I’ve come this far

I'll take all I gotta take\
roll the blankets, tack her up to ride\
I'll break what I gotta break\
gonna make it 'cross that great divide

You’ve known escapes and you've done em hard\
like back in '51 when you rushed the guards\
or down in Reid's Flat - such a terrible fight\
you get some wrong but you get some right

We’ll take all we’ve gotta take\
roll the blankets, tack her up to ride\
we'll make what we wanna make\
gonna make it 'cross that great divide

We'll be careful, we'll time it right\
next dark moon in the dead of night\
me and my baby and the heavens above\
me and Frankie we got all the love

We'll have all we gotta have\
running rivers, got the heavens above\
we have all we wanna have\
me and Frankie we got all the love

## Catherine Christie

Yeah we got what you need\
got flour, got tea and gin\
yeah we got what you’re after\
got sugar, lumber, nails and tin\
yeah we got what you need\
got picks and shovels, we got rum\

all hoping they’ll be the lucky ones

Me and my loving comrade\
we found our treasure, love is king\
and we made a chance to start it\
all over, over again\
here I can be your Catherine Christie\
here you can be my loving man\
we turned it in a new direction\
living this big love in a big new land

Yeah we got what you need\
got rope and canvas by the pound\
keep rolling up from the harbour\
through Apis Creek to the Peak Downs\
yeah we got what you need\
got picks and shovels, we got rum\
keep rolling in from every place\
all hoping they’ll be the lucky ones

Me and my loving comrade\
we found our treasure, love is king\
and we made a chance to start it\
all over, over again\
here I can be your Catherine Christie\
here you can be my loving man\
we turned it in a new direction\
living this big love in a big new land

## Darlinghurst

They work us to the bone for sure\
brothers, fathers, lovers, all\
it’s a wild wild thing to see\
that petty crime and poverty\
could lead you here

Held in sandstone cut from hands like mine\
a chink of light, the weight of time\
it’s a wild wild thing is fear\
oh Kitty I don’t know if i’ll ever make it out of here

And most, it’s true, I’ve seen before\
but in Darlinghurst I’ve seen it all\
it’s a wild wild thing to know\
the iron clang and hammer blow\
yeah I’ve seen the best and worst of men\
but will I ever get to see you again
