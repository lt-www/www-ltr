## The Rushing Dark

Benchseat ride six miles to town\
Sky blazing over then night rolled down\
Take the corners wide\
Your own blue nile  

Burlap sacks, blood and bone\
Clay straw sticks and stone\
Three hounds raised fat\
Just like that

When the rushing dark meets the swarming lights\
Cut like card through a blue-black night\
Itâs the dirt and damn, and the tear apart\
Ripped like card through a blue-black heart  

Gravel shoulder on a hairpin bend\
Tearing it down with your new-found friend\
Through the blare and shout\
Weâre gonna drown it out  

Milkweed stench and a crooked smile\
Wind rattled that place all through the night\
Looking right at you\
With his one good eye  

Hear it in your mother tongue\
Rumble down down below, ringing up up above

When the rushing dark meets the swarming lights\
Cut like card through a blue-black night\
Itâs the dirt and damn, and the tear apart\
Ripped like card through a blue-black heart
