## Blackwing

Blinding lightening as the thunder cracks\
Rumble from a graphite sky\
Half the pressure, twice the speed\
Drawing down a dark grey line

Palomino Blackwing 602\
Looking for a place to land\
There ain't much call for all that lead\
If you're only writing on the back of your hand

Steep dolerite, sleek barrel\
Hold the sharpest point\
Cinder and arrow

Shading down in a shady grove\
Acicular cedar grace\
Fat rain falling on flat bedrock\
Smudge the sketches of your face

## The Rushing Dark

Benchseat ride six miles to town\
Sky blazing over then night rolled down\
Take the corners wide\
Your own blue nile

Burlap sacks, blood and bone\
Clay straw sticks and stone\
Three hounds raised fat\
Just like that

When the rushing dark meets the swarming lights\
Cut like card through a blue-black night\
It’s the dirt and damn, and the tear apart\
Ripped like card through a blue-black heart

Gravel shoulder on a hairpin bend\
Tearing it down with your new found friend\
Through the blare and shout\
We’re gonna drown it out

Milkweed stench and a crooked smile\
Wind rattled that place all through the night\
Looking right at you\
With his one good eye

Hear it in your mother tongue\
Rumble down down below, ringing up up above

When the rushing dark meets the swarming lights\
Cut like card through the blue-black night\
It’s the dirt and damn, and the tear apart\
Ripped like card through a blue-black heart

## Room To Burn

So much trouble, so much chance\
All that strife, all this wide expanse\
If we're all playing shouldn't we be taking turns\
If it’s room you’re needing, brother we’ve got room to burn

Roaring water, ever-shifting plates\
Under all that poison behind some concrete and some gates\
Luck don't hold, the poison weeps\
For a sweet old world we're playing for keeps

Is it afflicted vision, or is it maybe you can't hear the sound\
From that magic bubble running on dirty big holes in the ground\
Down there somewhere don't it cause at least mild concern\
The climb gets steeper, brother we've got a lot to learn

Is your heart beating, or is it maybe you can't hear the sound,\
The climb gets steeper, brother it's such a long way down

## Darlin If We Could

I shouldn’t take the turn off\
I should use the new bypass\
But sometimes I’m drawn to take the road\
That leads me through our past

The streets we walked together\
Steep streets of your seaside town\
The park, the hall, the hardware store\
Sometimes I slow right down

To see if I can see you\
But I also hope I don’t\
Maybe this time I’ll keep from crying\
Then again I know I won’t

Oh darlin if we could would you wind back to the start\
Even if it all turned out the same, left you with a broken heart\
Oh darlin if we could, would you turn it all around\
Could you live those years again with me back here in your seaside town

The wharf is like a lookout\
The ocean rolls below\
Little shacks clinging on to the cliffs\
You know it never quite felt like home

Never quite shook the make-believe\
But how I tried to play the part\
Tried to make the pieces fit\
But those pieces pulled me all apart

## Everything Sings

Kids playing on the street below\
Laughter spills through open windows\
Suspended in a golden light\
You and I are gonna make believe tonight\
Let's pretend I can stay\
Make believe for one more day

Here where the ivy climbs\
You're the one I walk beside\
To shore against the ruin\
Shaking hearts in a darkening room

Raise a border to the rift\
Continental drift\
One moment seals a sweet lament\
On the precipice of your bed\
Whisper what the thunder said

Let’s pretend I can stay\
Make believe for one more day\
Suspended in a golden light\
Everything sings tonight

## Lasseter’s Gold

Quarter to four and you're almost there\
Blue pen twisted up in your hair\
Pull the roller, bolt it to the ground\
When you get out of there you just wanna get down

Can get pretty cold in a hot food van\
We take chips and change brother yeah you can\
Graveyard shift sees you to the light\
When you get out of there you just wanna get high\
Chasing down your rum and lines

Come on baby take me some place quiet\
And sing me a song I’ve been singing all night\
Gonna shake it up good for another round\
When you get out of there you really wanna get out

So much wrapped in golden fleece\
So many of them looking for Lasseter’s Reef\
Gonna take their chances on another try\
When you get out of there you just wanna get  high\
Chasing down your rum and lines

## Not Waiting Now

Whole maze of prints down a narrow track\
Wet road rushes above, pylon at my back\
Street light drips smudge the stars\
All the lights are flicking on down where the houses start

From that ledge I could see straight down\
I was waiting then, but I’m not waiting now

When the weather comes in from the west\
Feel the rush upon your skin, the pounding in your chest\
Defiant nights stand up to the dawn\
Suspended in between the letting go and the holding on

From that ledge I could see straight down\
I was waiting then, but I’m not waiting now

## <a name="moving-colours">Moving Colours</a>

From over here, without my glasses\
It’s such a pretty smudge of moving colours

You know from over here it doesn’t seem\
So like a raging tide, as a broken boat\
On its broken way, from a broken start\
Young fisher boys and the broken hearted

We curse the callousness of your petty counting\
The fear you love to feed with your poisoned spouting\
Shall we keep rattling round like a box of jaffas\
Filled up on room to spare in a flimsy package

I’m just over here, can’t find my glasses\
It’s such a pretty smudge of moving colours

## Up All Night

I wasn’t ready to leave\
Walked through the dawn, down to the sea\
Watching the sky turn in to blue\
I’ve been up all night daydreaming of you

Through this sweet mist for more\
I’m wending my way down to the shore\
Watching that boat hove in to view\
I’ve been up all night daydreaming of you

So as the swell grows calm\
I’ll magic myself into your arms\
Just close my eyes, it’s all I can do\
Were you up all night daydreaming too

## Green & Blue

Sweet breeze come in my window\
Hope hanging round my door\
I've got this forward leaning feeling\
Like I never had before

Shook the shadows from the blankets\
Chased the ghosts out of my bed\
I got a carefreeness singing in my chest\
And a ringing in my head

I got the threads of that old story\
I got this ache that's hard to place\
Got these little sparks hinting in the dark\
And a smile upon my face

The sun against my backbone\
Got this feeling in my blood\
I've got the shifting sands and re-shaped lands\
Of a valley after flood

Night birds calling near and far\
Blue-blush shimmer of an evening star

I've got these songs that keep on whispering\
I've got this wide open ground\
and I've been listening to what's ringing true\
and I got wired to the sound

Crackling steady like a tracking fuse\
Little seeds of wonder green and blue

Heartsease blooming right by your door\
Feed what you've been looking for
