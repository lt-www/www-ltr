## quiet island

catching the night bus to the coast  
tired and dusty and curled up and  
thinking this is the way it goes  
when you're travelling alone

seems to me this is some kind of quiet island  
out at sea while they're all at home  
but at least this could not be confuse with empty  
i am full of lonesome

i played last night at the local hotel  
and then at the bar, politely refusing unwanted offers from men  
and i leave the bar alone  
walk through the streets of the town to the place  
that tonight i've called home

and it's then that all this comes up creeping  
and it's you that i want to be talking to  
i'm finding it hard to see all this clearly  
in the dark plagued by thoughts of you

seems to me this is some kind of quiet island  
cold at sea while they're all at home  
and at least this could not be confused with empty  
i am full of lonesome
