## weather of words

tell me who was it who said  
don't let your imagination run away with you  
is this what you think they meant?  
you see i carry on conversations perfectly well  
when i'm by myself  
in my head i talk to you with ease

and when they said don't let it run  
maybe they meant that we should take it easier  
or maybe they meant that we should leave it somewhere else  
or perhaps we should encourage it to run away with somebody else

sure, i like to swap words with you  
but it's often easier, or i prefer, talking with myself  
we seem to make so many storms with our words  
and at the moment it's stormy enough in my head

it's been another night ignoring the phone  
here i am in my kitchen, here i am alone  
sure i like to sing songs for you  
but i'd often rather just sing for myself

putting words on paper sometimes makes me uncomfortable  
and i'd often rather let them fall, let them fly  
walking round the alley ways near my house  
i'm reminded of past conversations, and they catch me as i'm
passing by
