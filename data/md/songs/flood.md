## flood

don't look at me she said  
and could you stand a little further away  
cause i'm trying not to fan the flames  
please don't stare that way

to have these things  
on my mind  
makes my heart leap, makes me weak in the knees  
when i'm trying to keep things

i don't recall the day  
i realised that this was this feeling  
but it strikes me just the same  
that its just not leaving

don't look at me please  
cause i'm trying to keep things neat  
and could you please be careful what you say  
cause it makes me melt and flood away
