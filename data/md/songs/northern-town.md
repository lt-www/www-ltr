##Northern Town  

There's a boy in a northern town  
Street lights shining all around  
Thinks to himself what he's missed  
He says I just want to tell you this  

There's a girl out there that I've known  
And it's her that I'm thinking of  
Kicks himself for what he could've had  
He says I just wanna see you so bad  

There's a girl in the countryside  
She's looking up in to a starry night  
Singing no-one's gonna pin me down  
But I'd sure like you to come around  
If only you could come around
