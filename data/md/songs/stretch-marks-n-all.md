## stretch marks n all

i was walking home from his place one night  
and i was treading carefully  
and it wasn't just cause i was stoned or cause of the roadworks  
i was having a revelation

i'm not going to push my breasts up  
why fuck with gravity  
i'm not going to pretend that i'm some hairless creature  
and i'm not sorry, this is me

as i walk through the city streets by day  
i'm struck by all those starved looking women on billboards  
and all those teenage girls around me who look scarily the same  
tell me, if that's what i'm supposed to look like, what's supposed
to happen to my appetite?

well it's good to have good lovers and great to have good friends  
but you've got to know to love yourself and just be  
and if you can make yourself happy that's a pretty good place to
start  
and if you want to know the truth, i often have the best sex when
it's just me

so take off your make-up and take off your clothes  
and take a look at yourself, please do  
cause chances are  
you're beautiful  
just because you're you
