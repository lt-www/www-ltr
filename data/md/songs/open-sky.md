##Open Sky

I'll leave you with the crowd  
and the coloured lights  
All the happy noise   
the drunken laughing shouts  

Tonight I'm just a broken girl  
I can barely trust even my own self  
So I'm warning you, I'm telling you straight  
I have gotten lost along the way  

So keep a hold of those birds   
and the key  
I'm not sure you understand  
that I'm not what you've hoped I could be  

Tonight I'm stuck a lonely girl  
Who can barely face her own sorry self  
So I'm warning you, I'm telling you plain  
I don't know how it happened but I got lost along the way  
I'm not yours, you're not mine  
And I don't think that feels like  
Any kind of open sky  

It's painful but it's true, I'm no good to you  
And anyone can see that this is no good for me  
Cos I'm not yours, you're not mine  
And I don't think that feels like  
Any kind of open sky
