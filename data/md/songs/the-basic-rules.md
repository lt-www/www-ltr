##The Basic Rules  

Could you send me away to join a traveling show  
One where people pay to go to see terrifying displays   
Of derangement and will  
Cos I reckon I've got one that'd top the bill  

Oh I'd stand before the crowd,  
Baby let me show you how  
And how they'd roar -   
She's really gonna do it for sure!  
I'll tear myself apart  
It's a woman breaking her own heart  

I'll keep pushing trouble and strife   
Till something gives in  
When I can't make the pieces fit  

As you crash against the news  
Then you tell me what you want me to do  
So tell me how   
And what we're s'posed to do with this now  
As I fall against the thought  
That I've just gotta shake it off  

You keep pushing trouble and strife  
Till something gives in  
When you can't make the pieces fit
