## different postcodes

we send each other  
small treasures through the mail  
accompanied by snippets of stories  
telling some of our tales

like where i am we're rolling  
into a heady-scented spring  
melbourne's blue-skied late august  
and it's still too-chilled wind

and she says her days are growing greener  
it's been so long since i've seen her

i want to say thanks to the post-person  
thanks for getting it right  
i realise now i got most of your address wrong  
on the letter i sent to your new house the other night

you'll find us in different postcodes  
no danger of being close

but even my letters refuse to get lost  
this is not a lost love
