##Under The Night

The blinds are up, I'm watching the sky  
I can't sleep, it's been the longest night  
Replaying what you said  
It churns with the chop and whir of the fan above this bed  

I'm on fire  
I wanna be by your side  

We were stretched out under the night  
High above the heavy traffic and the sirens screaming by  
Stayed up to meet the light  
Held me in your arms that time and you said  
Oh what would it be like  

Driving down these thoughts of you  
Another lousy night in another noisy room  
But that 'what would it be like'  
Keeps clamoring underneath   
all these other people's dogs and cars and fights
