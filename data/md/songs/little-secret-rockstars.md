## little secret rockstars

too many times  
i've settled for providing  
some boy with some sex and drugs  
and i've let him be the rock n roll

i've often gone to write a tune  
that was good enough for someone like you  
and there i was thinking i didn't know how to do it  
but actually it dawned on me its got more to do with your attitude

well don't get me wrong - i'm not saying its your fault  
if there's one thing that i'll own it's my responsibility  
but i'm certainly not interested in leaving it up to them  
it's about time i sang my world out, it's about time i joined in

too many times  
i've settled for providing  
those boys with their sex and drugs  
and i've let them be the rock n roll

i guess you could extend this argument to encompass  
just about everything we do every day  
why can't we all be our own little secret rockstars  
why can't we all lend our voices to the music, to the world
