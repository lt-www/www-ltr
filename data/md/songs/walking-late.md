## walking late

i wonder what you'd say to me now  
wonder what you'd have to say to me about it all  
it's not that everything's so bad  
it's only i wish i had a way to keep this down  
darling till i work it out  
you know it's gonna be a long time going

sleeping late in to the day  
keep crying all around the place  
everybody tells me it'll pass  
i'm telling you isn't this what everybody does

so as part of this escape  
i've taken to walking late at night  
pretend you're by my side  
and let you whisper that you'll be a long time going  
you're gonna be a long time going
