## somewhere around

he's wandering around  
wondering about the timing  
and of what he's found

he finds it difficult to see  
what has come before  
and what he could believe

would he be surprised  
if he saw the whole scene played  
back through his lover's eyes

she's growing watchful  
tries to be prepared for shocks  
and brace herself for falls

and as for all the disappointments  
she finds it difficult to see  
that it could be  
any other way  
it could be

and would she be surprised  
if she saw the whole scene played  
back through her lover's eyes

there's something about you  
somewhere around you  
there's someone around you  
that there's something about
