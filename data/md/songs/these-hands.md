## these hands

why do we say, oh it's the least i could do  
and what's being made,  
and what'll be made of this when we're through

these are things that i recognise  
it's just that they've got your voice  
and your smell and your eyes

and it's okay, you can come right down now  
down right here,  
i seem to fit in somehow

why do we say oh, it could be good  
and what's being made  
and what'll be misunderstood

these are things that i recognise  
it's just that they've got your voice  
and your smell and your eyes

and it's okay, you can be yourself now  
down right here  
i seem to fit in somehow

where i'm going  
it's nowhere new  
it's just that i haven't been there yet  
with you

and don't mind me if i start to cry  
it's just that you've got this voice  
and these hands and these eyes

and where i'm going  
its nowhere new  
it's just that i haven't been there yet  
with you
