## made a lie

our evenings were fine  
what's yours was mine  
it felt like nothing but plenty of time

our mornings were slow  
no hurry to go  
felt like nothing but plenty of time

thought we were over the rush of the first time  
thought we were over the rush, thought it was alright

these days stretch along  
and i'm here and you're gone  
and without you i feel  
i'm left here with all of this time

this time  
i made a lie

i made a lie of us
