## Already Gone

You gave me nothing but warnings  
I kept dreaming our love alive  
It broke apart this morning  
Struck down knowing that you'll never be mine  

I tried to count the times  
I've stood here just to watch you leave  
I know you had to go but  
I Never thought the going would go on for keeps  

I got sick this morning  
Brokenhearted is what it is  
Yeah I find distractions  
But it's so hard to get away from this  

Cause I see you in my doorway  
I see you laying there across my bed  
I know you had to go but  
I've been hanging on to those things you said  

And I can't count the times we  
Stood there crying and holding on  
I know you had to go but I  
Never though the going would go on this long  

Now the storm is coming  
I stand here watching the sky turn black  
I know you had to go but  
I always figured you'd be coming back
