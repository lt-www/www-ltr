## home sized town

i can't help but look twice at  
every car that looks a bit like yours  
in this home sized town

these falling fences  
steep streets and the river gums  
and that rambling rose

everybody knows your business here  
everywhere i go i'm reminded dear  
it's just that time of year

i'll take these supplies  
up to my second floor room  
and close the blinds

it'd be alright if i didn't always feel this tired  
is what i've found

i don't know how long i'm gonna stay  
maybe if i'm feeling better i'll try and call  
if i can think of what to say
