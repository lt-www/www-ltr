## Falling

Your arm rides the wind out the passenger side  
I've got the wheel babe, you know how I like to drive  
Here where these fields stretch to meet the sky  
No one in front of us and nothing behind  

Each morning oh to wake from that very same dream  
Where is it we were gonna run to  
and tell me when are we gonna leave  

Here I am, falling, all over again  
You know I'm waking each morning  
From that very same dream  
Imagining the shape  
That you made with me  
It's your name I've been calling  
It's sure some kinda spell  
I'm under  
Here I am, falling, all over again  
Its your name I've been calling  

Off we go again, so fiercely from the start  
Little human stories, little human hearts  

Where is it we were gonna run to  
Tell me when are we gonna leave
