## with extra bile

since our first gasp of breath  
we've been fed so many lies  
coming from all directions  
for all of our lives

since when did we start believing  
everything they feed us  
just cause it came from the mouth of a man in a lab coat  
or you saw it there in newsprint, or you heard it on tv

and don't it give you indigestion  
and don't you think its well and truly time  
we started spewing it right back at them  
and this time with extra bile

who was it who told them to tell me  
this country's mine  
and who was it who told them to tell me  
i'm only allowed to have one lover at a time  
and you'd better make sure you can play the game  
you'd better make sure you've learned your lines  
you'd better make sure you can compete  
and everything'll be fine

since when did we start believing  
we're all separate from this earth  
and that when it comes to who's most worthy  
that somehow it's anglo rich men first

so if we're living in the first world  
that makes us first at what  
at colonising women, other cultures  
other people, this earth
