## i have been a soldier too

i have been a soldier too, buried in the meadow  
i have been a soldier too, buried in the street  
i have been a soldier too, buried in brackish water  
i have been a soldier too, buried in the sea

i have had a peasant girl, buried in the meadow  
i have had a factory girl, buried in the street  
i have had a fisher boy, buried in brackish water  
i have had a sailor boy, buried in the sea
