## your shelter

i can't help noticing  
how you wear yourself out  
looking for shelter  
haven't you worked out that  
that shelter is right here with me

you're so safe  
my limbs all wrap up around you  
you can be as small as you want  
you can stay as small as you need  
i'll give you all my quiet  
and we'll rest  
we'll rest  
you shelter is right here with me
