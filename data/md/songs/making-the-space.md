## making the space

i didn't even notice  
i didn't even know  
maybe it's time  
i left you alone  
with your waiting  
with your wondering why  
i don't comfort  
i don't comfort you

i'm making the space for  
i'm making the room  
what it takes to stay

trying to work out  
some ways to say  
this is comfort  
but it's gonna change  
and you didn't even notice  
you didn't even know  
maybe it's time  
i left you alone

making the space for  
making the room  
what it takes to stay with you
