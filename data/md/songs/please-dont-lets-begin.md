##Please Don't Let's Begin  

Letters carved out with a blade  
Left and right, a circle made  
Two names scratched here  
Charred branch, ten years  

Left and right, a circle formed  
Would come apart but for this warmth  
Left alone will come undone  
You can't rely on winter sun  

Oh the time it takes  
First unravels, then it breaks  
Please don't let's begin  

Untended gardens fall  
Prey to weeds and undergrowth  
Then through a drought nine seasons long  
The shock of rain, a flood's begun
