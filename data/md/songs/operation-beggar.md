## operation beggar

i was busking one night down on swanston street  
when i befriended tom and helen who were just trying to make ends
meet  
asking for a bit of loose change from passers by  
and the way those cops were behaving you'd think it was a crime to
try to survive

they were getting hassled by a couple of cops  
so i went over to where they were standing and i gave tom a couple
of bucks  
one cop he turned to me, stared at my breasts and said hey
sweetheart, why don't you get lost  
why do you have to be such an asshole, and since when has it been a
crime to be kind to someone

so i called the cop an asshole, i guess that's the wrong thing to
do  
you've got to watch what you're saying when you're talking to the
boys in blue  
you see lately in this city they've been charging people on the
street  
and it's just too bad if they don't like the look of you,  
if you've got the wrong coloured skin, or you just can't get enough
to eat

i went back to my guitar and started packing up my stuff  
and that same cop followed me over and said sweetheart, you're
pushing your luck  
nobody calls me an asshole  
well at that point, i had to laugh

but then after all, he's the cop  
he's the one in the uniform  
he's the one with the big black baton  
he's the one with the gun

so as for tom and helen, and all the other thousands on the
streets  
our governments and businesses are waging war with some kind help
from their police  
so take a closer look at this pseudo-democratic capitalist violent
state  
are you relaxed and comfortable?

and so to kennett and his cronies from your law-abiding fools  
give us race tracks and casinos, not hospitals or schools  
and don't forget to let us have some great big private prisons
too  
and tell me again, who is it who's guilty?
