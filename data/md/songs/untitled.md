she's curled up  
with her arms around her knees  
and her whole body's shaking  
and she can't explain this grief

she wonders  
about what it is she's done  
and she thinks isn't it a shame  
its not something she can just wish away

and she wonders  
about what exactly it is that they've done  
and she remembers them say  
its all alright dear  
we'll strap your legs up here  
this wont take long

she knows what she didn't want

she wonders  
about what she was too shocked  
and too distressed to say  
to those outside the clinic clutching  
small plastic dolls  
with their warnings that its not too late  
to be saved

this is not anything like regret  
this is an unexplainable sorrow  
these are the memories our bodies our living  
this is a woman whose body remembers
