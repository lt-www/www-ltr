## not grown ups

i remember us living inside that house  
and i remember us walking the long way round to school  
and in the winter our gloves would be wet through with frost  
and i remember wanting to be just like you

we'd put on plays and concerts  
we had a secret club with code names  
(i was meatpie and you were powderpuff)  
you were gregarious and dramatic  
i was the clumsy, cuddly little sister  
and we had a whole world in our backyard

if i scrambled to a tree top  
a long way off the ground  
you'd say please be careful  
and i'd say it's a long way down

now you're getting married  
we've got to go and get ourselves a couple of fancy frocks  
you ask if i'll be your best woman  
i say of course, it'll be like a giant game of dress-ups

lets grow in all directions  
as we learn and as we love  
just because we're no longer children  
doesn't mean we have to be grown-ups

i have a picture of you in your house  
with mudbricks and vegies and children and games  
and love and gumboots and chooks  
and i'll be hanging out to visit  
and you'll say hey look who's here  
it's your laughing, loving, crazy, singing aunt

when they scramble to the tree tops  
a long way off the ground  
you'll be there to say have fun, but please be careful  
and they'll say hey mum, look where i am  
its a long way down
