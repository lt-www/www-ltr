## Can't Sleep For Dreaming  

A swarm of sudden silver  
Winged swath against the sky  
Then they form a perfect arrow  
Above me with the sun in my eyes  

Their form keeps on shifting  
Fog drifting from a stand of trees  
Out there where we ran laughing  
Kicking like kids through the piles of leaves  

And I can't help it  
Like those bells that just keep ringing  
Been hit by it  
And I can't sleep for dreaming  

It's everywhere that I go  
Going back to everywhere that I've been  
From that city steeped in deep snow  
To this valley steeped in rolling green  

As I lean against this window  
Rain beading from glass to sill  
I keep thinking how we made it better  
How we could make it better still  

I can't help it  
Give me shoulder shaking! Give me crying out loud!  
I've been hit by it  
And I can't sleep for dreaming now  

I can't help it  
Like those bells that just keep ringing  
I've been hit by it  
And I can't sleep for dreaming
