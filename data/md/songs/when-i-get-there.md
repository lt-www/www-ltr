## When I Get There

I'm coming home  
It's been too long  
Don't know what I'll find  
Don't know what there's left of  

So many wrong turns  
And oh what I've messed up  
So much has been burned  
That I can't forget, love  

All the places I've been  
You know I never let go  
You've been here in my head  
You've been here in my heart love  

Oh to see your dear face  
To call out your dear name  
Old friend of mine  
I know it can't be the same  

But when I get there  
I know that we'll both see  
What's always been here  
You know you've always been with me  

When I get there  
I know that we'll both see  
What's always been clear  
You know you'll always be with me
