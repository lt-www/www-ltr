## for wanting

i can't explain to you  
that i'm grieving for a love i can't keep  
and i can't contain a love  
that's not letting me sleep  
and i can't sleep tonight for wanting to  
watch you  
for wanting to

what i've left unsaid i wanted you to know  
and if i'm supposed to leave  
you're supposed to let go  
and i can't leave tonight for wanting to  
watch you  
for wanting to
