##As You Find It

I'm gonna follow this track  
Through the scrub and down to the road  
I've got the wind at my back  
Got my collar up against the cold  

Gonna race straight down  
Through the scrub and down through the lot  
And in less than an hour  
I could be standing right there by your door  

Heading out in the dark  
Gonna stand up and strain as I pedal hard    

Take it as you find it
