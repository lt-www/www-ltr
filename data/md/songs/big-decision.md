## big decision

i do not expect that you'll be too happy about this  
and i do not expect that you'll feel too kindly towards me now

but here i stand with my big decision  
and i know that i've made it before  
but now i'm gonna go

and it's painful to see the way that you like me  
it'd be easy if we all had a switch  
could just turn it off, turn it off,  
and you know, sometimes i wish  
that you never saw me like this

now that you've asked me to stay  
i've got to say thankyou much more than you'd know  
but i'm gonna go, i've got to go, i'm going to go, i've got to go
