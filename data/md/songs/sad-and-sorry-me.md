## sad and sorry me

this is not a song to say it's over  
and this is not a song to tell you i think this is the end  
if anything it's a chance for me to apologize and say  
i don't know why it's so hard, this up and down you and me thing

i haven't been as good to you as i could have been  
and i think it's fair to say the same goes in reverse  
and it's certainly true to say i think you're one of the most
incredible and spirited and beautiful people i know  
but when it comes to us in combination, it's not easy

you told me your pain isn't close enough to the surface  
and we can both see that my pain is painfully clear to see  
you said at least i'm honest and i'm open  
well if i'm honest, if i'm open, then

i'm sad and i'm thoughtless and i'm crying, i'm crying  
and i'm pissed off and i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry

maybe next time that we're together  
i wont be such a shit  
and maybe i'll be able to tell you  
what it is i really want and say look, what i really want is this

and i wept into your chest  
and you said i feel absent from this
