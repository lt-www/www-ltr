##Alice

She liked to think of them as creatures  
Lining up along the road right there on display  
Sometimes she would tell them secrets  
Lean her head against the frame, watching them sway  

Or watch the back of his neck  

She collected sounds and pieces  
Of what she heard behind the door in the darkened hall  
Crouched beneath the phone, in shadow  
She kept a careful list of what she might use them for  

Oh light of mine  
Looking like she means it  
Oh light of mine  
Like you know she feels it  
Oh light of mine
