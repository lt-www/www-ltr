## lack of light

i wont assume  
but i already asked you  
and you couldn't tell me

and regardless of the lack of light  
i can't keep these eyes shut  
and my chest is pressed tight

in this uncertainty  
and with this unsteady breath  
we need all the help we can get

there's a sadness in this  
here, taste this salty sadness

how are we ever going to know  
our way home  
please keep my hands pressed tight

...together we just might
