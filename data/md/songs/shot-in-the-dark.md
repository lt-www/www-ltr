## shot in the dark

take a walk down to the all-nighter  
cut across the block at the corner  
and then round to the right

light flickers, i squint my eyes  
hot night all the lights up bright

there's your sturdy arms, your steady legs,  
your steadiness

take a shot in the dark, make me call out  
take a steady look, then lean ahead
