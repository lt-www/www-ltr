## lunch

we're sitting on the couch  
with the tv on the floor  
some old black and white movie  
gosh you sure are a bore

now you're moving closer  
christ, you're breathing in my ear  
you say

and i don't know about you  
but i sure got one hell of an appetite

come on baby let's make, come on baby let's make,  
come on baby let's make lunch

i want something spicy  
you say \`yeah, i like it hot  
how about a salami sizzle  
or a burger with the lot'

sorry to be a disappointment  
but i don't eat meat, that's right, i'm a vegetarian

lay me down on a bed of lettuce  
don't you want your salad tossed  
i've got a zucchini fetish  
and i still need something that rhymes with tossed
