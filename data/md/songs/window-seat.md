## window seat

i've got a window seat, its starting to rain  
i'll be spending the next two and a half days on this train  
but i don't mind so much  
i've got a good book and plenty of thinking to do

i've been travelling, singing to all sorts of folks  
with a tent, my guitar and a change of clothes  
and i've loved spending this much time on my own  
but i'm so excited to be coming home  
to you

i'm missing my friends, my garden, my bike  
the day after next i'll go for a ride  
head out in the sunshine along merry creek  
and then back to the friendliest terrace on amess street

but now i'm rocketing  
i'm rolling  
on this train going a hundred k's an hour  
and i'm day dreaming bout the way we move

we are so careful and so courageous  
we are so gentle its a little bit dangerous  
and who would've thought i could feel this sure  
find myself in this big love

i've missed you my friend but i haven't been lonely  
if you want, i reckon you can always find company  
but now's not too soon  
i'm ready to be coming home to you

i'm rocketing  
i'm rolling  
on this train going a hundred ks an hour  
and i'm dreaming bout the way we move  
dreaming bout the way
