## in between

between your house and mine  
in between today and some time ago  
i seem to have found  
myself alone with this somehow

some things we harbour deep  
some things make it harder to sleep  
if you asked me all again  
i'd say i hope so

in this unravelling  
here flooded by the sticky small of spring  
i wanted you to know  
i still hope so

between your lies and mine  
in between this strife and some time ago  
i seemed to have found  
myself alone with this somehow

i'm still surprised to find  
myself alone with this sometimes
