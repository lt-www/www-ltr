##Over In Threes  

Wind is whipping this place apart  
Rattling windows and a rattling heart  
Birds are flying over in threes  
Lighting up briefly in the trees  

You know it's nasty and you know its name  
The question's ugly but the fact remains  
Just standing there in broad daylight  
He takes another kick from the right  

Streaks of grey across a white-wash sky  
You don't forget the first big lie  
Just like you don't forget the first big hit  

This fella's mean streak is a mile wide  
You can bet he'll burn it up tonight  
Swig from cans behind his bright headlights  
You can bet he's saddled up to ride  

The question's ugly but the fact remains
