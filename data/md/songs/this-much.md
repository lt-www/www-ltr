## this much

we've walked out along the water  
down at the beach in the middle of the night  
and we've cried about the world, watched the sun go down  
and we've played billy bragg songs in my bedroom on a sunny
afternoon

and we've shared plenty of pots of chamomile tea  
at three in the morning  
and i've filled you with caffeine, you fill me with pain  
but you fill me with the wonder of it too

and you used to make me nervous  
and sometimes you still do  
and sometimes i think it's funny that we rarely touch  
and it makes me kind of giddy that i like you this much

no there's not many others who can do this  
and none quite like you do  
i mean i've never ever met anyone like anyone else before  
but i certainly haven't met anyone like you
