## smorgasbord

we've got a smorgasbord of causes  
so step right up  
and take your pick

well it may not be a necessity  
for you to fight every day of you life  
but don't you think you've got a responsibility  
as a creature of this world

you may not have alot of cash in your pockets  
but you'll probably never be poor  
and did you know that two-thirds of the world  
has got a two hour walk to the nearest phone

so tell me do you really need that plastic bag  
and tell me you can't spare a couple of bucks for that street kid  
and tell me do you really need to drive that car to work  
and tell me what do you think your heart is for?

you've got to keep contempt for those men in suits  
and their words about money and what they say is important  
we all live in this world, try to live lightly, live lightly  
and did you know they want to rip up kakadu to make bombs  
and you tell me it's not your problem, well

what do you think this world is for?  
and what do you think your heart is for?

so tell me do you really need that plastic bag  
and tell me do you really need to hose that path down  
and tell me you can't spare a couple of bucks for that street kid

we've got a smorgasbord of causes  
so step right up  
and take your pick
