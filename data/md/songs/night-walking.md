## night walking

to the beach along the unlit road  
wipe the sweat from my eyes  
i need a hand to hold

back to the pull of the undertow  
wipe the blood from my mouth  
i need a hand to hold

feel it  
running out of your breath  
all this talking  
feel it  
pounding in your chest  
night walking

in the morning when it comes up light  
i'll be there lying by your side
