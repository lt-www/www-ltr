## Noir

We said goodnight before  
But you're still standing there  
Darkening the door  
There's not much left to say  

Here we are  
It's noir, all the way  

More trouble than it's worth  
This we know too well my friend  
And it wouldn't been the first  
Time we slipped to this again  

I can't stay  
Cause its noir, all the way
