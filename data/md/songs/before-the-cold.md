## before the cold

please, no  
please no not you too  
please not both my sons  
not both at once, like this

come back  
come back and see this town  
come and lay down your arms  
i beg of you

how come  
how come you're drawn to this  
i find it hard to recognise  
these soldiers of mine  
how can you reconcile yourself to this

hold on  
i hold on to the past  
before the cold crept inside  
you had the clearest eyes  
your father and i  
watched you wonder, laugh and cry  
for gentler things
