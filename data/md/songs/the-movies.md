## the movies

she gets up early in the morning  
takes the bus to the video store  
she works the arthouse and the foreign language  
hums the soundtracks as she walks the floor

its kinda dark inside but she quite likes that  
works the checkout and recites the lines  
on quiet days she watches all her favourites  
she's seen the leopard a thousand times

she's worked here for four years now  
more really if you count the summers before  
she knows its only temporary  
she's got big plans that she's working towards

she's working on a movie  
already knows what its gonna be called  
she's picked out who'll play the leading lady  
and hums her theme song as she walks the floor
