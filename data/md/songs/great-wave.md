## Great Wave

You push your change around the counter  
I push my knees up under the bar  
We've gone beyond the call and favour  
Like we're watching from afar  
  
The colours bleed out from the hills  
The hills turn black across the field  
  
It's a great wave that's coming down  
  
Nobody's paying that close attention  
To the races on the TV screens  
I pick your change up off the counter  
And head over to the cigarette machine  
  
I've seen that way your eyes drop to your glass  
Like there was a mile behind  
The way your eyes weren't meeting mine  
  
Oh it's a great wave coming down
