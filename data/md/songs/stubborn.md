## stubborn

she knows just what to say  
and here i am with tear-stained cheeks again  
and i want to send her love  
cause she's stubborn and she's gorgeous  
and she's difficult to budge

our love is strong and strange  
it's funny what we manage to arrange  
the road is in her heart  
and she's always moving on  
and yet she's difficult to budge

there are many troubles she carries around  
but she knows when to lay her troubles down  
and she knows how it feels to be so tired

she says i'm the one that shines  
but she's the one who's generous and kind  
and she can always make me laugh  
this woman's joy is firmly in my heart
