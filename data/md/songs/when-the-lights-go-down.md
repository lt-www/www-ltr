##When The Lights Go Down

I'll be there, out there in the crowd  
I'll arrive alone, and I'll be by myself when I leave to go  
When the lights go down, I'll be staring out  
I want you to know this feels like my private show  

Course I know all the words  
And I know just how that pretty mouth of yours   
Whispers and curls  
Swaying gently along  
Under my breath I'll sing harmony to my favourite songs  

Well I'm hardly shy, but when it comes to this  
If I could make you see, you'll be glad I did  

So I'll dream of this as I watch you play  
Honey I'm oh so sure we're gonna meet some day
