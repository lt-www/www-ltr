## Sweet Turnaround

Garden full of diamond trees  
Little drops that spark, little mysteries  
Right here in my hand  
Find a place to start, a place to land  

Like that butterfly there on the line  
Keep it gentle, keep me kind  
Let these pretty pearls roll  
From my fingers  

Open to the sound  
Like a porch full of song  
Oh sweet turnaround  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long  

Let it burn so bright that you can't deny  
Let the lightning strike at your wondering whys  
Come on let it take you  
By surprise  

Open to the sound  
Like a porch full of song  
Oh sweet turnaround  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long  

Gonna jump this time  
And it's only just begun  
Oh sweet turnaround  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long
