## Big News

Light pours across the hillside  
Spills across the cane  
Rolls right on with the road ahead  
Sets the sky to flame  

It's hard sometimes to place it  
But it's there in all those songs  
You're right here in the front of my mind  
Asking baby what went wrong  

We kept standing there  
We've been acting like it's such big news  
That you don't know what you got till it's what you loose  

I'll drive on in the darkness  
Leaving it behind  
From the bonfire glow to the harbour lights  
Slipping it from my mind  

And lean a little closer  
To all those songs I play  
Yeah I'll keep singing till the sun comes up  
However far away  

We're already free  
Remember darlin that's what you said  
Now it's here with me  
And it's a big wide road ahead
