## botticelli blue eyes

on the phone last night she said she wanted to get run over  
and on the phone last night i said i wanted to run away  
well, slightly different ideas, but the same motivation  
we both need some time away from all of this

its not easy with 900 k's between us  
and it's getting hard to hold onto  
our crashes our floods our rainbow kisses  
my swollen heart, sophie, when i'm with you

and if there's a hundred songs that sound like this one  
it's cause there's a hundred hearts that ache like mine  
this is another song for my sweet orange angel  
from your somewhat saturated botticelli blue eyes

it's frustrating, what i've got at my disposal  
to let her know how i feel  
just a handful of cliches and half a dozen chords  
e, a, i've never felt this way before

well if there's a thousand songs that sound like this one  
it's cause there's a thousand hearts that ache like mine  
this is another song for my sweet orange angel  
from your somewhat saturated botticelli blue eyes

all those words that i'm supposed to use  
they don't feel like mine  
do we have to make a whole new language  
just to let our feelings come alive

and if there's a million songs...
