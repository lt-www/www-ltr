## evie and i

she takes me by the hand  
so she can show me around  
we walk out through the orchard  
and over to the dusty ground

carefully she treads  
you must be very quiet she says  
evie and i  
looking for small things

down in to the garden we go  
down here with the earth between  
our fingers and our toes

crouching in the dirt  
she says i think my favourites are these beetles, and the worms  
evie and i  
looking for small things

travelling alone with lots of quiet time  
when the days unravel slow  
there's lots of things i find

the pain that comes and goes  
and this calmness that takes time to grow  
looking for small things
