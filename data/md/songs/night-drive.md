## night drive

i stop to fill the car up on the road out of town  
and smile as i take the change  
and say yeah it's good to see some rain

i'm not in a hurry, and i've already come this far  
wet night, big trucks rolling past  
should've known it from the start  
could've guessed i'd fall this hard

you'd brush back my hair  
we'd drive out past the city streets  
watch the sky rush past  
go down to the river in the summer heat  
with my head in your lap and your hands on me

all these things left to remind me  
of the way it was  
all these memories that i come across  
i still feel your hand in mine  
even after all this time

you'd brush back my hair  
we'd drive out past the city streets  
watch the trees rush past  
go down to the river in the summer heat  
with my head in your lap and your hands on me
