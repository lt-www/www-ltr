## Till The Season

Yeah I heard it  
Oh brother of course I did  
The circles we move in just aint that big  

And yeah I've seen it  
Coming from the start  
A great big case of a restless heart!  

You couldn't leave it  
But you just kept tearing it down  
Oh we've been round and round  

With you in circles  
With you there in the dark  
So stuck and sorry with your restless past  

Look what you found  
Wake up one morning it's so bright so clear  
Just take a look around  
If it's growing it won't ripen â€˜til its season's here  

Yeah we've known circles  
And another will roll in time  
Oh brother of mine  

The season's changing in  
This little lucky town
