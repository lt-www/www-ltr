## the upfield line

coming home from three weeks on the road  
i'll walk the two blocks from the station  
smile with anticipation, and  
i'll be tired, excitable and wired  
there'll be spaghetti on the stove  
and motown on the stereo, and

you will dance me round the kitchen  
and out in to the hall  
i will press you up against  
my body and the wall

love it comes in close,  
love it comes and goes  
love it comes in close
