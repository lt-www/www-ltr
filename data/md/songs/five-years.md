## five years

the calves are calling for their mothers  
across the field tonight  
i'll go inside and pull up blankets  
turn off the light

all the what ifs that follow me around  
if i could shut them out  
then i would shake these thoughts of intimacy  
when i watch your mouth

you told me five years  
you told me all of this  
is working its way out

all the what ifs that follow me around  
if i could shut them out  
then i would shake these pictures of you  
that keep on rolling round
