## winter sun

start my day with bitter coffee  
in a patch of winter sun  
i'll clear away the books, the bottles,  
from the night just gone

i came here with one hand open  
the other holding on  
to find a place to work, be quiet,  
see what comes when i'm alone  
i'll be careful, i'll be strong

each night around the stove  
i am keeping warm  
sing the words that make it grow  
don't stay away too long

i came here with one hand open  
the other holding on  
and i know that if the hold is gentle  
we can keep pushing on  
don't you stay out there too long
