## left standing

it's bigger out here at night  
bigger and there's a different light  
i've been looking for sometime  
looking for sometime now

i had just read in the guide  
i'd see the biggest trees left standing  
so i went out for a ride  
along the river weld

it said there'd be tracks on which you could ride  
but the tracks had turned to roads  
roads to carry trucks  
to carry the biggest trees left standing

in the valley of the styx  
and all across the tarkine  
in more places than you'd expect  
the story is just the same

in more places than you'd expect  
people are chained to dozers  
and hanging from the tops of trees  
so there can be some left standing
