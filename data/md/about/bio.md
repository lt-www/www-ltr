Lauded for writing "some of the most simple and beautiful songs you will hear" (****The Age), Lucie Thorne has earned her place as one of Australia's most striking contemporary songsmiths. With twelve releases to her name and a prodigious touring schedule, Lucie Thorne continues to carve out an extraordinary creative career.

After several years working quietly under the radar, Thorne's 2009 release Black Across The Field brought her to the attention of a much broader audience. This album was shortlisted for the prestigious Australian Music Prize; was awarded Best Roots Album of 2009 by the Sydney Morning Herald; and had a song selected for inclusion on a Universal Records international compilation alongside Leonard Cohen and Radiohead.

Since then Lucie has been touring far and wide in a sensational duo collaboration with legendary drummer Hamish Stuart. Their 2011 release Bonfires In Silver City was hailed as "World-class” (AMG); “an album of powerful intimacy and poetic deliverance” (Life&Style) that "...reveals a subtlety and craft that eclipses Thorne's prior work" (Rhythms Magazine)

Thorne & Stuart’s 2015 release Everything Sings Tonight was a bold, poetic and musically adventurous creative benchmark for the pair. Recorded predominately in Berlin and featuring heavyweight guests including Bo Ramsey, Chris Abrahams & Greg Brown, Everything Sings Tonight shines with “atmospheric, innovative brilliance” (**** Sydney Morning Herald).

Thorne's new album - Kitty & Frank - will be released internationally on 26 August 2019.  An extraordinary art/pop concept record, Kitty & Frank traces the wild true stories of young frontier woman Kitty Walsh and her lover, the charismatic bandit and bushranger Frank Gardiner. In the 1860’s, Gold Fever came to  Wheogo NSW and, like Deadwood, it didn’t end well. Painting landscapes with dream-soaked synths, irresistible beats, poetry and pathos, with Kitty & Frank Thorne has woven an astonishing arc of vignettes to create an album which is at once timeless and utterly modern.

Along with a remarkably consistent Australian touring schedule, Lucie also tours regularly across the European and North American continents. She lives in Melbourne’s north.

“Thorne conjures a simple narrative flow that, like a Raymond Carver story, transforms everyday life into high art” (The Canberra Times)
