Delighted to be unveiling the Kitty & Frank cover art! A painting by fabulous Australian artist Jonathon Throsby. I've been a fan of Jonno's work for years and first saw this painting - entitled 'Mungo' - at an exhibition of JT's in Melbourne many moons ago. I'm so thrilled that it's gracing the cover.  You can [purchase your copy now] (https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/album/pre-order-kitty-frank) - on LP, CD, or as a digital download - and we'll lovingly send out all preorders from the start of August! xx

We made a video for WHEOGO HILL! Starring.. WHEOGO HILL! Footage by Craig Lawler (of [Blind Freddy's Bushranger Tours](https://www.blindfreddytours.com/) fame) & John Daly, edited by Simon Bailey & Damian Fitzgerald. To quote Lawler, 'In the 1860's Gold Fever came to Wheogo, and like *Deadwood*, it didn't end well'. In the central west of NSW, in the heart of Wiradjuri country, Wheogo is where Kitty's family, the Walshes, were peaceably farming cattle before gold was discovered at Lambing Flat. It's where Kitty first met Frank. And it's where they ran from when the heat of the law hit fever pitch. [Find out more about Kitty & Frank](albums/kitty-and-frank). 

WHEOGO HILL Single tour starts this weekend in Melbourne with two shows at the Merri Creek Tavern, with Hamish Stuart & Alice Pearl Williams. All details and ticket links [here](shows).
