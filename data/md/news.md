Dear friends, I am so happy to be sharing the news that my selection of favourite papa T poems: TIM THORNE - GREATEST HITS - Poems 1968-2021 will be published this September by [Puncher & Wattmann.](https://puncherandwattmann.com)  

I started putting this collection together in the months after Tim & Stephanie both died...
I read every book of Tim’s from cover to cover...
Over long months in that big old house on the hill, I trawled reams of writings, folders of scraps and miscellany and unpublished poems...
Tim possessed a truly brilliant mind, produced a profound body of work, and had a mighty mighty heart.
And what a way with words.

I am thrilled that *TT’s Greatest Hits* will be out in beautiful print this spring! 
News of launches/readings to come. And in the meantime, you'll find copies of the six titles of Tim's that are still in print [here](http://www.timthornepoet.com)

New Merch! ‘Labyrinth’ T Shirts - feat. [Tim Thorne’s](http://www.timthornepoet.com) 1982 drawing of Theseus & the Minotaur! [On sale now via bandcamp](http://www.luciethorne.bandcamp.com) & shipped by xmas! 

Thats right folks! I’m making a limited edition run of these fabulous tees with this incredible drawing - by my dad! Story of the picture below. [Place your orders now](http://www.luciethorne.bandcamp.com) & we'll send them out from Dec 8th. xo   

It was 1982. I was in prep at West Launceston Primary School, and Dad, as our stay-at-home parent, would partake in the school’s roster of parental helpers (known then by the  antiquated term ‘Mother Help’). Rather than, you know, read a story - from a book - to the class like the other mums… ah… Tim, in his extraordinary way, would free-style/story-tell tales from Greek Mythology which he accompanied by dozens of his home-made drawings!! I discovered a satchel filled with these amazing drawings when I was sorting through the old family home last year. This one of Theseus & the Minotaur in the Labyrinth is one of my faves. I have it framed on my wall. And now you can wear it on a t-shirt!

Thrilled to share the news that the stunning new album [LUCK by The Yearlings](http://theyearlings1.bandcamp.com/album/luck) will be released this June on my label Little Secret Records! and you can get your ears around the first two songs now! Head to their bandcamp page to [preorder your album](http://theyearlings1.bandcamp.com/album/luck) [LP | CD | DL] - and lean on in to [DOWNTOWN](http://theyearlings1.bandcamp.com/track/downtown) & [GONE ARE THE DAYS](http://theyearlings1.bandcamp.com/track/gone-are-the-days). 

It was a total joy and honour to collaborate with The Yearlings to produce [LUCK](http://theyearlings1.bandcamp.com/album/luck). The album was recorded with dream team Hamish Stuart (drums) & James Haselwood (bass) in just a couple of days last winter, tracked live to tape by Mick Wordley at the beautiful Mixmasters Studio in South Australia, and completed by the nuanced mixing wizardry of Chris Shaw in Austin, Texas. It's an album of great songs by great players and it sounds *really freaking good*. I’m so excited to start sharing what we made. Do your ears and hearts a favour xo

### 27 March 2023

Sara Tindley ( 14.11.66 - 15.01.23 )  

We’ve set up a [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/c39e90b4) campaign to bring our beautiful Sara’s extraordinary final sonic offering *Greetings from Lake St Clair* out on vinyl. 

![](data/image/news/sara1.jpeg)

We made [this record](https://saratindley.bandcamp.com) in August last year. Sara was seriously unwell with terminal cancer, and it was less than a year since Lily’s tragic death. She didn’t know if she could even manage to record it. But with that incredible fire, strength and huge-hearted-ness that Sara shone with - in three amazing days in the studio - she smashed it out of the park. And the whole thing turned around in lightning speed. Just 2 months later we were launching it to the most overwhelmingly love-charged packed-out home-town crowd in her beloved Lismore. I’m lucky enough to have performed with Sara many times, but this night was like nothing I’ve ever experienced. Transcendent.  

...Sara loved the idea of one of her albums finally getting pressed to vinyl, but she knew she was unlikely to be around to see that eventuate. But we're making it happen! Head to [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/c39e90b4) to find out more. NB: any contribution is fabulous! And if you donate $50+ we’ll send you a record once it's hot off the press. ($100 and we’ll send you two:)

Happy Release Day little rekkid! I proudly and lovingly present to you, dear listener, KITTY & FRANK. You can now listen to the whole album [right here on bandcamp](https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/album/kitty-frank) - where you can also [purchase the album on LP, CD, or as a digital download](https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/album/kitty-frank). 

![](data/image/news/LT_RD2.jpeg)

As many of you know by now, this is an album about two real-life characters, a 'concept record' about a young frontier woman, Kitty Walsh, and the charismatic bandit who became her lover, Frank Gardiner. I first heard the [wild true tales](albums/kitty-and-frank/lawler) of Kitty & Frank from Craig Lawler, tour operator at [Blind Freddys Bushranger Tours](albums/kitty-and-frank/lawler), after a show at the Gooloogong Log Cabin back in 2015. By the time I'd landed home in Melbourne that night I'd written 'Nothing Comes Close', and demo-d it there n then, in the wee hours, in my little cabin in Pascoe Vale, under thunderous skies. (There's a bloody loud thunder clap on that original demo right when I sing "...my ears strain for hooves like thunder." *Seriously!) A little whiles later I wrote 'All The Love", and when I started playing those two songs out, the idea of writing a whole album for Kitty & Frank crept in...  

Fast forward to April 2018, when I sent myself off on a song-writing retreat to a little shack on the Howqua River in north eastern Victoria. I had a week's supplies, a simple recording set-up, plenty of firewood, a borrowed midi-keyboard, and songs to write! The whole wild story of Kitty & Frank had clearly been rolling round my head for a long time by this stage, but it was there in that week on the Howqua that the *shape* of the record really flew in, something shifted/lifted, and I could suddenly taste just what kinda record I was gonna make. 

In the spring of 2018 I assembled my *dreamteam* (again!!) - Hamish Stuart, Dave Symes and Chris Abrahams - and at the start of the summer we tracked nearly all of the album live to tape over three days at Sydney's Golden Retriever Studios with consummate engineer Simon Berckelman. I played with those recordings some more back home at the Rezza ranch over the summer, and mixed the album with the wonderful John Lee at Phaedra Studios in April 2019. 

I'm so grateful to the whole beautiful team for everything everyone's brought to this project. I really love what we've made. And I'm SO EXCITED to finally share it all with all of you! 

Happy listening, lovin comrades

the next song from Kitty & Frank - 'Catherine Christie' - is now streaming on all the streams! You can listen now on [spotify](spotify:track:7GVmxWyH7ePZo1OjURJUtW), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQrpHAn7lGU) or dial it up on your platform of choice. 'Catherine Christie' opens Side B of the album, and it's one of my favourite chapters in the 'Kitty & Frank' story; they've managed to escape the heat of the law in the south... and make it all the way to Queensland, where they start a new life - as Mr & Mrs Christie, running a general supplies store at Apis Creek, on the road to the Peak Downs goldfields. Featuring my mighty mighty band Hamish Stuart, Dave Symes and Chris Abrahams!

### 5 June 2019

We made a video for WHEOGO HILL! Starring.. WHEOGO HILL! Footage by Craig Lawler (of [Blind Freddy's Bushranger Tours](https://www.blindfreddytours.com/) fame) & John Daly, edited by Simon Bailey & Damian Fitzgerald. To quote Lawler, 'In the 1860's Gold Fever came to Wheogo, and like *Deadwood*, it didn't end well'. In the central west of NSW, in the heart of Wiradjuri country, Wheogo is where Kitty's family, the Walshes, were peaceably farming cattle before gold was discovered at Lambing Flat. It's where Kitty first met Frank. And it's where they ran from when the heat of the law hit fever pitch. [Find out more about Kitty & Frank](albums/kitty-and-frank).

WHEOGO HILL Single tour starts this weekend in Melbourne with two shows at the Merri Creek Tavern, with Hamish Stuart & Alice Pearl Williams. All details and ticket links [here](shows).
