### 26 August 2019

Happy Release Day little rekkid! I proudly and lovingly present to you, dear listener, KITTY & FRANK. You can now listen to the whole album [right here on bandcamp](https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/album/kitty-frank) - where you can also [purchase the album on LP, CD, or as a digital download](https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/album/kitty-frank). 

![](data/image/news/LT_RD2.jpeg)

As many of you know by now, this is an album about two real-life characters, a 'concept record' about a young frontier woman, Kitty Walsh, and the charismatic bandit who became her lover, Frank Gardiner. I first heard the [wild true tales](albums/kitty-and-frank/lawler) of Kitty & Frank from Craig Lawler, tour operator at [Blind Freddys Bushranger Tours](albums/kitty-and-frank/lawler), after a show at the Gooloogong Log Cabin back in 2015. By the time I'd landed home in Melbourne that night I'd written 'Nothing Comes Close', and demo-d it there n then, in the wee hours, in my little cabin in Pascoe Vale, under thunderous skies. (There's a bloody loud thunder clap on that original demo right when I sing "...my ears strain for hooves like thunder." *Seriously!) A little whiles later I wrote 'All The Love", and when I started playing those two songs out, the idea of writing a whole album for Kitty & Frank crept in...  

Fast forward to April 2018, when I sent myself off on a song-writing retreat to a little shack on the Howqua River in north eastern Victoria. I had a week's supplies, a simple recording set-up, plenty of firewood, a borrowed midi-keyboard, and songs to write! The whole wild story of Kitty & Frank had clearly been rolling round my head for a long time by this stage, but it was there in that week on the Howqua that the *shape* of the record really flew in, something shifted/lifted, and I could suddenly taste just what kinda record I was gonna make. 

In the spring of 2018 I assembled my *dreamteam* (again!!) - Hamish Stuart, Dave Symes and Chris Abrahams - and at the start of the summer we tracked nearly all of the album live to tape over three days at Sydney's Golden Retriever Studios with consummate engineer Simon Berckelman. I played with those recordings some more back home at the Rezza ranch over the summer, and mixed the album with the wonderful John Lee at Phaedra Studios in April 2019. 

I'm so grateful to the whole beautiful team for everything everyone's brought to this project. I really love what we've made. And I'm SO EXCITED to finally share it all with all of you! 

Happy listening, lovin comrades

### 23 August 2019

the next song from Kitty & Frank - 'Catherine Christie' - is now streaming on all the streams! You can listen now on [spotify](spotify:track:7GVmxWyH7ePZo1OjURJUtW), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQrpHAn7lGU) or dial it up on your platform of choice. 'Catherine Christie' opens Side B of the album, and it's one of my favourite chapters in the 'Kitty & Frank' story; they've managed to escape the heat of the law in the south... and make it all the way to Queensland, where they start a new life - as Mr & Mrs Christie, running a general supplies store at Apis Creek, on the road to the Peak Downs goldfields. Featuring my mighty mighty band Hamish Stuart, Dave Symes and Chris Abrahams!

We made a video for WHEOGO HILL! Starring.. WHEOGO HILL! Footage by Craig Lawler (of [Blind Freddy's Bushranger Tours](https://www.blindfreddytours.com/) fame) & John Daly, edited by Simon Bailey & Damian Fitzgerald. To quote Lawler, 'In the 1860's Gold Fever came to Wheogo, and like *Deadwood*, it didn't end well'. In the central west of NSW, in the heart of Wiradjuri country, Wheogo is where Kitty's family, the Walshes, were peaceably farming cattle before gold was discovered at Lambing Flat. It's where Kitty first met Frank. And it's where they ran from when the heat of the law hit fever pitch. [Find out more about Kitty & Frank](albums/kitty-and-frank).

WHEOGO HILL Single tour starts this weekend in Melbourne with two shows at the Merri Creek Tavern, with Hamish Stuart & Alice Pearl Williams. All details and ticket links [here](shows).
