### 4 January 2018

Loving thanks to all who helped make 2017 such a heartening and amazing time out on the road. I'm taking a little break from touring over the summer to work on this next crop of songs, with just a handful of shows coming up over the next couple of months. In other news... the back catalogue just hit the bandcamps! That's right folks, (nearly) all my albums are now available, directly from me, in digital form (as well as in physical form, as ever, of course). [Check it out](https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/). And stay tuned for new-music news.. xo LT [luciethorne.bandcamp.com](https://luciethorne.bandcamp.com/)
